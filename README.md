## WHAT IS HACKATHON ?
*A hackathon is a design sprint-like event; often, in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, domain experts, and others collaborate intensively on software projects.*
>*__Hackathons are where your crazy idea becomes reality.__*
## WHY SHOULD I GO TO HACKATHON ?
### *HACKATHONS ARE FOR LEARNING:*
 * Hackathons are a super-condensed learning experience. 
 * We learn about idea generation, working with others, managing a project, how to use the libraries, frameworks, and APIs that are used by software engineers every day, how to work to a deadline, how to debug, how to do version control, how to deploy, how to test and improve your work, how to present your work on stage, and much more.
 ### *HACKATHONS ARE FOR MEETING PEOPLE:*
 * We are going to make some new friends. If you’re into tech or making stuff, you’re going to love the inventive, smart, fun people you meet at hackathons.
 *  It’s a fantastic place to share ideas, learn from others, and build connections.Speaking of building connections, hackathons are like career fairs on steroids.
