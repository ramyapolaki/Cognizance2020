## WHAT IS HACKATHON ?
*A hackathon is a design sprint-like event; often, in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, domain experts, and others collaborate intensively on software projects.*
>*__Hackathons are where your crazy idea becomes reality.__*
## __WHY SHOULD I GO TO HACKATHON ?__
### *HACKATHONS ARE FOR LEARNING:*
 * Hackathons are a super-condensed learning experience. 
 * We learn about idea generation, working with others, managing a project, how to use the libraries, frameworks, and APIs that are used by software engineers every day, how to work to a deadline, how to debug, how to do version control, how to deploy, how to test and improve your work, how to present your work on stage, and much more.
 ### *HACKATHONS ARE FOR MEETING PEOPLE:*
 * We are going to make some new friends. If you’re into tech or making stuff, you’re going to love the inventive, smart, fun people you meet at hackathons.
 *  It’s a fantastic place to share ideas, learn from others, and build connections.Speaking of building connections, hackathons are like career fairs on steroids.

 * Namara provides a platform for hackers to collaborate on data projects, and ThinkData Works is proud to sponsor hackathons by providing both open data and custom catalogues, depending on the needs of the organizers and hackers. Simply, we want to make sourcing and collaborating on data as easy as possible, so that hackers can focus on developing better solutions.

Data, Delivered.
* The first 24 hours of a hackathon is often sunk into finding data. Get that time back, and give hackers the opportunity to build smarter apps and solutions quicker.

* A single point of access branching out to many users
Single Point Of Access.
* Let teams collaborate on data from a single platform. Namara provides both analytical features and an open API, letting teams plug into any data instantly.

* Thousands of sources, limitless potential.
